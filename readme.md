# Doxer
Doxer is a project designed to make it sort of easy to write documentation about different projects.  At the moment it is just an idea.  However, it will use markdown on the composition end and mongodb as a repository.  It will be written in php as that is a platform that is regularly avaiable where I work.   Because of my inspiration it will also be using the waypoints.js Jquery plugin to help keep the navigation in sync with the content.

## Why Doxer
We need a way to not only create documentation but to output it in a nice way for consumption.  I really, really, really like the way the documentation at [parse.com][pd] looks so I decided to make a tool that will let me and my team create documentation very similar to it.

Check back often for updates; I'm excited about working on this project so I'll probably be moving on it pretty fast.  If you see me doing something stupid please let me know at bilL@rawlinson.us
